# About
This repo holds public material belonging to my research projects. The source code is prepared in a way that makes replication of results as seamless as possible. Nonetheless, you will have to do some work yourself, like installing dependencies and providing paths to input data, in order to execute the code successfully. If you run into issues that you cannot resolve, feel free to contact me.

## Included
Material is sorted by paper title and included in the folder 'code'.
